MakersMaker is an programming specialized online education platform.

  - Based on project
  - Can share code with our tutor in real-time
  - lecture streaming & 1-to-1 video call tutoring
  - Provide automatically generated portfolios

# Why did we select this project?
There are already some popular education platforms like [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
But in case of Coursera, it provides general education, not focused on programming.
 Also, Udacity have lectures based on programming and projects. But, they don't provide tools for software engineering which is necessary for programming. We feel inconvenient from these, So we decided to make our own convenient education platform specialized for programmers.

# New Features

  - Both code editer and lecture videos are shown in lecture page
  - Student and Tutor can share their code in lecture page simultaneously
  - Automatically generated portfolios

You can also:
  - View detail process of each project in lecture page & portfolio page
  - Can easily access to software engineering tools (such as gantt chart, flow chart, etc,.) at Dashboard page
